### Hi there 👋

* 📐 I love UI/UX design. As a detail-oriented person, I always do my best to enhance user interaction, whether it's by simplifying navigation, creating intuitive interfaces, or conducting user research to understand their needs and preferences.
* 🖥 Web development and responsive design truly fascinate me. I have experience working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and I've used these technologies to create a variety of projects, ranging from responsive websites to interactive web apps.
* 📱 Mobile development has always intrigued me, and it's something I've pursued in my spare time. Gradually, I've been enhancing my skills by working on various productivity and finance apps. My experience includes working with SwiftUI and React Native, which I've used to bring my app concepts to life.
* 📊 Along with my skills in software development, I also have experience in data science. My favorite part is data visualization, where I can turn complicated data into something easy to understand.
