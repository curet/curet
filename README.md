### Hi there 👋

* 📐 I love UI/UX Design. It is really interesting to start with a blank page and create something out of it.
* 🖥 Web Development and Responsive Design really fascinates me. I'm currently improving my Front-End Development skills with HTML, CSS and JavaScript before jumping to a specific framework
* 📱 Mobile Development is one of those cool things I always wanted to learn and I've been working bit by bit on my spear time to improve my skills on some productivity apps I've been working on with.
* 📊 In combination of my skills a favorite area in Data Science is Data Visualization and the idea of simplify abstract data into something that can be easily understood.
